# Commit Plan - Agentic Survey Research Team

## âœ… Completed
- **Commit 1: Basic Project Setup** - Project structure, dependencies, main entry point
- **Commit 2: Core Configuration** - Environment management, Anthropic LLM setup, logging
- **Commit 3: Simple Chat Interface** - Terminal chat loop, user input handling, response formatting
- **Commit 4: Research Coordinator Agent** - CrewAI agent for research coordination, background action visibility
- **Commit 5: Multi-Agent Coordination** - Literature Search Agent + ResearchTeam for coordinated multi-agent research
- **Commit 6: Complete Research Workflow** - Implemented full 4-agent workflow: Coordinator â†’ Literature Searcher â†’ Research Analyst â†’ Report Writer. Now generates comprehensive 2000-3000 word research reports as the final output.
- **Commit 7: Model Upgrade to Claude Sonnet 4** - Updated LLM model to claude-sonnet-4-20250514. Significantly improved research quality with more detailed responses, better structured information, and higher accuracy.
- **Commit 8: Cost Tracking Infrastructure** - Implemented comprehensive API cost monitoring with `cost_tracker.py`, `tracked_llm.py`, and updated configuration. Features real-time cost calculation, SQLite database storage, budget alerts, and cost summaries. All agents now use cost-tracked LLM instances with per-agent token usage monitoring.
