# Commit Plan - Agentic Survey Research Team

## âœ… Completed
- **Commit 1: Basic Project Setup** - Project structure, dependencies, main entry point
- **Commit 2: Core Configuration** - Environment management, Anthropic LLM setup, logging
- **Commit 3: Simple Chat Interface** - Terminal chat loop, user input handling, response formatting
- **Commit 4: Research Coordinator Agent** - CrewAI agent for research coordination, background action visibility
- **Commit 5: Multi-Agent Coordination** - Literature Search Agent + ResearchTeam for coordinated multi-agent research
- **Commit 6: Complete Research Workflow** - Implemented full 4-agent workflow: Coordinator â†’ Literature Searcher â†’ Research Analyst â†’ Report Writer. Now generates comprehensive 2000-3000 word research reports as the final output.
- **Commit 7: Model Upgrade to Claude Sonnet 4** - Updated LLM model to claude-sonnet-4-20250514. Significantly improved research quality with more detailed responses, better structured information, and higher accuracy.
- **Commit 8: Cost Tracking Infrastructure** - Implemented comprehensive API cost monitoring with `cost_tracker.py`, `tracked_llm.py`, and updated configuration. Features real-time cost calculation, SQLite database storage, budget alerts, and cost summaries. All agents now use cost-tracked LLM instances with per-agent token usage monitoring.
- **Commit 9: Cost Optimization Features** - Implemented comprehensive cost optimization system with intelligent prompt optimization (redundancy removal, agent-specific optimizations), query response caching (24-hour SQLite-based cache with hit tracking), budget management (real-time warnings at 70%/90% thresholds), cost predictions, and enhanced chat interface with `cache`/`optimize` commands. Full integration with TrackedLLM. All tests passing (5/5).
- **Commit 10: Web UI Foundation with FastAPI** - Created modern web interface using FastAPI with responsive Bootstrap design. Implemented HTML templates with Jinja2, basic research query routes, cost tracking sidebar, agent status display, and full integration with existing ResearchTeam workflow. Added FastAPI dependencies and tested web interface functionality.
- **Commit 10.1: Comprehensive Documentation Suite** - Created complete documentation ecosystem including comprehensive README.md with setup/usage instructions, detailed API documentation covering all modules/classes/functions, comprehensive user guide with step-by-step instructions and best practices, and developer guide with architecture details and contributing guidelines. Enhanced project onboarding and maintainability.

## ðŸ“‹ Next Tasks (in order)
